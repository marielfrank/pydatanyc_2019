### Before the tutorial

You will need Python version 3.5 or later installed (ideally via `pip` or `conda`).
If you have a chance please, [install `nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/install.html) and download the following data packages:

- `wordnet`
- `stopwords`
- `punkt`

### Getting set up

The next step is to open, clone, or download the tutorial materials in this repository.

I've you've never used Git or Jupyter Notebook before, no worries! You can open this all up using Binder:

If you are familiar with Git and Jupyter Notebook, you can run the clone command and open up the package locally:

    git clone https://github.com/marielfrank/pydatanyc_2019.git

Then you'll be able to follow along using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).
